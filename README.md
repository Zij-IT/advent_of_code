# AdventOfCode

## The What
This is just a nice storage space for my Advent of Code solutions in Haskell. For those that are not familiar with Advent of Code, I recommend you check it out at [here](adventofcode.com).

## The How
If you are interested in running my solutions, feel free to follow these steps. This assumes you have cabal installed on your computer. If you are interested in seeing what the result of a particular day is, you will have to edit the day number in App/Main.hs. This should be changed at some point.

> cd adent_of_code
> cabal run
```

## The Who
Just me :D
